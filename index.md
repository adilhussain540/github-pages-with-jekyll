title: "Decentralized Applications"

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about the new era of decentralized applications commonly known as Dapps.

Dapps use blockchain technology. Blockchain at its core is a digital ledger of transactions that are duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computers in a blockchain. Dapps transactions are slower and harder to scale as compared to traditional applications due to the limitations of current blockchains.

We'll go through more details about Dapps in my future blogs.
