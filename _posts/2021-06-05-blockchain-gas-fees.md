# The concept of Gas fees in a Blockchain
To understand the Gas fees concept in blockchain better, we've to understand how the traditional online transaction processing system works.


In this modern era, it is highly unlikely that anyone didn't get the chance to interact with a transaction processing system such as PayPal, Google Pay, Stripe, etc.
These payment gateways are integrated into all modern applications where online payments are involved. But they don't come for free.

Let's take an example of PayPal, it charges $0.25 USD for every payment you make + 2.9% of the amount you receive from the US-based client. Because PayPal is the central 
entity here that processes our transactions, it gets to keep the whole amount (if we ignore the taxes that it pays to Government). 
One important thing to keep in mind here, the amount PayPal receives is independent of how many transactions it isÂ currently processing.

Now imagine, there's no single entity that processes your transaction but a whole network of computer systems commonly known as Blockchain. The transaction fee is known as
Gas fees in blockchain and it'll be distributed as an award between all the computer systems that'll be involved in successfully processing and validating your transactions.

Unlike the fixed percentage transaction fee in a system like PayPal, the Gas fees may rise up depending on how many transactions are currently being processed in the Blockchain.
